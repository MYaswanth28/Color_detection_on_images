# **Color Detection on Images** 
 This project is a simple color detection program implemented using OpenCV and Python. It allows users to interactively select a color range using trackbars and filter that color from an image in real-time. The filtered image will show only the selected color, while other colors will be displayed in grayscale.

## Features

- Real-time color detection and filtering.
- Interactive GUI with trackbars to adjust color range.
- Visual feedback with original image, HSV image, color mask, and filtered result.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
3. Keep Path of Image Correctly
   
# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy

# Usage

1. Upon running the script, a window named "TrackBars" will open, showing six trackbars for Hue Min, Hue Max, Saturation Min, Saturation Max, Value Min, and Value Max.
2. Adjust the trackbars to select the desired color range.
3. The program will display the original image, HSV image, color mask, and the resulting filtered image in real-time.
4. Experiment with different color ranges to observe the color detection results.
